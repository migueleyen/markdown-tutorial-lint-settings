please if markdown file has *.md unique extension why i need commonmark if all platforms saben que es un archivo de markdown ? 

Even though **Markdown files use the `.md` extension**, different platforms interpret Markdown **differently**. The `.md` extension only tells you it's a Markdown file, but it **does not guarantee** that all platforms will render it the same way.  

### **Why Do You Still Need CommonMark?**  

### **1. Markdown Has No Official Standard (Before CommonMark)**  
- Markdown was originally created by John Gruber in 2004 with **no strict specification**.  
- Over time, platforms like **GitHub, Reddit, and Obsidian** created their own Markdown versions.  
- **Result?** The same `.md` file might look different depending on where you open it.  

### **2. Inconsistent Rendering Across Platforms**  
Here‚Äôs an example:  
#### **Tables (`.md` file)**
```md
| Name  | Age |
|-------|-----|
| Alice | 25  |
| Bob   | 30  |
```
- **GitHub supports this.** ‚úÖ  
- **Original Markdown does NOT.** ‚ùå  

#### **Footnotes (`.md` file)**
```md
This is a sentence with a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: This is the footnote text.
```
- **Obsidian supports this.** ‚úÖ  
- **GitHub does NOT.** ‚ùå  

Without a standard like **CommonMark**, you might write a `.md` file that works in **one app but breaks in another.**  

### **3. CommonMark = Consistency**  
CommonMark provides:  
‚úî **A strict, predictable syntax** ‚Üí No surprises when switching platforms.  
‚úî **A foundation for extended Markdown** ‚Üí GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM), etc.  
‚úî **Compatibility** ‚Üí Ensures `.md` files render consistently in tools like VS Code, Obsidian, and Pandoc.

### **So, Why Use CommonMark?**  
- **The `.md` extension alone does not guarantee a universal standard.**  
- **CommonMark prevents Markdown formatting issues** between platforms.  
- **It ensures `.md` files look the same everywhere.**
