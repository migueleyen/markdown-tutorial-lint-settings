The sentence **"Itâ€™s a plain text format for writing structured documents, based on formatting conventions from email and Usenet"** means that **Markdown** (or another plain text format) follows the same text-based formatting rules that were used in early **email** systems and **Usenet** discussions.  

### **What is Usenet?**  
**Usenet** was an early internet discussion system (from the 1980s) that worked like a **global bulletin board**. It allowed users to post messages in **newsgroups**, similar to how modern forums and Reddit work today.  

- It was **text-only** (no images or fancy formatting).  
- People used **plain text symbols** to format messages (just like Markdown does today).  
- It influenced **email formatting**, early chat systems, and Markdown syntax.  



### **Why Mention Usenet?**  
Markdown was designed to be **familiar** and **easy to read** because it followed formatting styles that people already used in **email** and **Usenet**. This made it a natural way to write formatted text **without needing HTML or a rich text editor**.
